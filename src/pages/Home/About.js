            <p className="text-gray-600">A personal chef will prepare meals for private clients in home kitchens or commercial kitchens depending on their client's needs or preferences. This can be done daily or the meals can be cooked, frozen and reheated weekly.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">During this time, the chef will prepare meal(s) specified by the clientâ€™s dietary requirements or desired menu selection. Each meal will be stored with instructions so that the client will be able to heat the food or it can be served fresh. Most personal chefs prepare food to be reheated unless they are hired for an event or group.</p>
